## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The Analysis is to determine the efficacy of loans using machine learning.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The information is financial data that are the primary concerns of lenders when judging to approve loans
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
there are 514 potential loans with borrowers with 3 derorgatory marks
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
 indentifying the target variable. splitting the data, creating the model, fitting the model, predicting the test sample, comparing predictions to real
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).
used a logistic regression model and tested with a confusion matrix

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model :
  * Precision: 97% 
    Recall: 94%





## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* The Logistic Regression model creates a clear judgement with little error. I would recommend using this model in order to classify beneficial loans for the lender.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
